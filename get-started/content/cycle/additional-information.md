# Additional Information

## Information for Tool Vendors

If you are a BPMN tool vendor and would like your tool to integrate (better) with Camunda Cycle, you can build your own connector and plug it into cycle. Here you can find more information about building [cycle connectors](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-cycle-connectors).

## User Guide for Cycle

Please find additional information about cycle in the [user guide](/manual/master/webapps/cycle).
