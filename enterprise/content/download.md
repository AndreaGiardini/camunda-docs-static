# What Should I Download?

Not sure which distribution to download? Find more information about the [Full Distribution](/manual/latest/introduction/downloading-camunda/#full-distribution) and the [Standalone Web Application](/manual/latest/introduction/downloading-camunda/#standalone-web-application-distribution) in our user guide.

Furthermore we provide downloads for [Camunda Cycle]({{< relref "#camunda-cycle" >}}), the [Camunda Web Modeler]({{< relref "#camunda-web-modeler" >}}) and [Camunda Enterprise Extensions]({{< relref "#enterprise-extensions" >}}) on this page.


# Full Distributions and Standalone Web Applications of the Enterprise Edition

This page contains the latest versions of all supported branches. In addition we provide alpha releases of the current development branch. Please note that a alpha release is not fully tested and just a snapshot of the current development state.

## Community vs. Enterprise Releases

There is both a community and an enterprise edition of Camunda BPM. Among these, we distinguish between four different types of releases:

1. **Major Release**: The Major release contains features and bugfixes. It is fully tested and meant to be used for production systems. The Major release may contain incompatible API changes. The release is done in parallel for the community edition and for the enterprise edition.
2. **Minor Release**: The Minor release contains features and bugfixes. It is fully tested and meant to be used for production systems. In Minor releases we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner. The release is done in parallel for the community edition and for the enterprise edition.
3. **Development Release**: On the community branch and on the enterprise branch we release *ALPHA* versions in short iteration cycles. Development releases contain the latest features and bug fixes. The Development release is not fully tested and is a snapshot of the current development state.
4. **Patch Release**: On the enterprise branch we perform patch releases in which we backport the latest bug fixes. Patch releases do not contain new features and are meant to be used for production systems. Patch releases are fully tested and are only available to enterprise customers.

The following drawing illustrates the different release types for the community edition and the enterprise edition.

# Camunda Cycle

With Camunda BPM 7.2.0 we have migrated Camunda Cycle into a standalone project. We did this to reduce the tight coupling between Camunda Cycle and the Camunda BPM platform. This eases our development efforts for Cycle and allows others to increase participation.

# Camunda Modeler

The Camunda Modeler is an open source process modeling tool. It allows you to edit BPMN process diagrams and DMN decision tables. The Eclipse based BPMN Modeler can be integrated in your Eclipse IDE as plugin.

* [Camunda Modeler](http://camunda.org/download/modeler/)
* [Deprecated: Camunda Modeler Eclipse Plugin](/manual/latest/modeler/eclipse-plugin/update-sites/)


# Camunda Web Modeler

The Camunda Web Modeler is an OEM version of the Signavio Process Editor. It allows you to edit BPMN 2.0 process models with your web browser. In comparison to the Camunda Modeler it is targeted at less technical people, e.g. business analysts or requirements engineers.

The Camunda Web Modeler is stripped down to fulfill all necessary tasks in process automation projects and is perfectly aligned with the Camunda BPM platform.

{{< note title="Licensing Information" class="info" >}}
  Please note that the Camunda Web Modeler is an optional part of the Camunda BPM platform. It is licensed differently and separately. It is only available for enterprise subscription customers.
