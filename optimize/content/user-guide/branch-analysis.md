If a process contains more than one end-event, it is useful to know which path tokens take when they get to an end event. Camunda Optimize can show you a statistical analysis for a given end event and a gateway. This analysis includes how tokens were split at the gateway in question and how many of the tokens of each branch reached the end event.
