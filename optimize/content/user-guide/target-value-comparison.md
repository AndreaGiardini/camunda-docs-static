Based on the [duration heatmap]({{< relref "duration.md" >}}), Optimize allows you to specify a target value for every activity. For example, if a user task has to be completed within one day, you can set the target value to one day. If the average time it takes to complete the user task exceeds this target value, the task is highlighted in the heatmap.

The following video displays the duration heatmap view:
